# ICSB 2022

Dear all,

thank you all for participating in the workshop! Unfortunately, shortly
afterwards I got the first symptoms of what turned out to be COVID-19.
Although I was generally wearing a mask, I did not wear one during the the
workshop. You might want to get tested.

Kind regards,

j.
