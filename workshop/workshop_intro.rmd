## Why am I using tmod?

 * CERNO is fast and reproducible
 * included gene sets are unique and useful
 * unique visualizations
 * tidyverse coding style rather than BioConductor coding style


]

.pull-right[

## When am I not using tmod?
 
 * I am required to use fgsea (using not the most popular package is often
   a pain in the neck!)

In these cases, I use both CERNO and fgsea and study the differences

 * small gene universe
   - olink
   - some metabolic profiling projects
   - nanostring

In this cases, I often use PLAGE (also implemented in tmod)

## Three things more important than the algorithm

--

 * a good model producing the ranked gene list
   * filtering noise
   * careful statistical analysis

--

 * carefully selected gene sets 

--

 * detailed inspection of results
   * look at the NEs / ROC curves ("evidence plots")

# Tips and tricks

---

## Working with an a priori hypothesis

  * *never* use the current data set to propose your hypothesis! 
  * use expert knowledge:
    * literature
    * experiments
  * which genes are expected to be transcriptionally regulated

---

## Effect size, AUC and ROC curves

 * good effect size measure does not depend
   on sample size (although can be correlated with p-value)
 * AUC (area under curve) has advantages:
   * easy to interpret and show graphically
   * related to rank biserial correlation (effect size for the U-test)


---

## Should we test for up- or down-regulated gene sets?

.pull-left[

### Yes 

 * nicely split gene sets into two groups
 * red and blue dots

However,

 * you can miss gene sets which contain anti-correlated genes



]


.pull-right[

### No

 * many gene sets contain genes that go both up and down
 * you can always diagnose the gene sets later, checking whether they
   mostly go up or down
 * terser visualisation
 * eigengenes can be used for visualisation as well

## Eigengenes

Basically: run a PCA on a gene set, take the first component (mind the
sign!), use this value as a relative per-sample pathway score
